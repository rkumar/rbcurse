Eric S. Raymond, in his book The Art of Unix Programming,[2] summarizes the Unix philosophy as the widely-used KISS Principle of "Keep it Simple, Stupid."[3] He also provides a series of design rules:

*    Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.
*    Rule of Clarity: Clarity is better than cleverness.
*    Rule of Composition: Design programs to be connected to other programs.
*    Rule of Separation: Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.
*    Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.
*    Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.
*    Rule of Transparency: Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier.
*    Rule of Robustness: Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity.
*    Rule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be stupid and robust.[4]
*    Rule of Least Surprise: In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.
*    Rule of Silence: When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.
*    Rule of Repair: When you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible.
*    Rule of Economy: Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time.
*    Rule of Generation: Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can.
*    Rule of Optimization: Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.
*    Rule of Diversity: Distrust all claims for "one true way".
*    Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.
